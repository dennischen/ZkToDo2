5) Within the cmd.exe configure the location of your jdk1.5 or above with
	set JAVA_HOME=C:\users\simon\jdk1.5
6) With the cmd.exe configure the location of your maven install
	set MAVEN_HOME=C:\users\simon\apache\maven
7) Ensure that both the java.exe and the mvn.bat folders are on your 
binary PATH with the command
	set PATH=%JAVA_HOME%\bin;%MAVEN_HOME%\bin;%PATH%

folders are on your path
