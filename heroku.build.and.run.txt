Heroku Cloud (see http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git): 

Heroku Linux install (their tools are ruby based)

	sudo apt-get install ruby-full
	http://toolbelt.heroku.com/linux/readme
	
First build with the instructions in commandline.build.and.run.txt

	#in the folder where you have the source and can compile build the app with commandline.build.and.run.txt
	heroku login
	heroku create --stack cedar
	#this will give you the "http://APP_ID.herokuapp.com/" and 
	#the heroku git repo address "git@heroku.com:APP_ID.git" 
	# (you can add this target to another copy of the code with "git remote add upstream git@heroku.com:glowing-light-1070.git")
	#push the code up to heroku to compile/package/deploy/start 
	git push heroku master
	#the following command opens a browser at the correct app (very helpful when you have different dev,qa,prod instances)
	heroku open

Running locally with Heroku toolbelt & PostgreSQL DB
	
	export DATABASE_URL=postgres://foodToGoUser:foodToGoPassword@localhost/testdb
	mvn package
	foreman start

Note

	"hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto=update" in file src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/classes/postgresql.zktodo2.properties 
	should create the required database table. Note that setting it to 'validate' 
	is not something that Heroku db seems to like. Of course those setting is a bit lazy you can have 
	hibernate generate the sql ddl script and use the local/heroku tools to manage your schema 
	for a real app.
