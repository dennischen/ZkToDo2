
These instructions have been tested on Eclipse 3.7.1 "Indigo" 

Eclipse Indigo now has official JGit/EGit and m2eclipse plug-ins support. . 

INSURE YOU HAVE THE PLUGINS AND THEIR CONNECTOR

	1) [The first step may not be required in later Inidgo versions] Confirm that Egit is 'on'. 
	"Help > Install New Software.." chose from the dropdown "Eclipse Git Plugin Update Site". 
	If it is not in the dropdown click 'Available Software Sites' link on 
	that dialogue. Scroll down looking for the url 
		'http://download.eclipse.org/egit/updates' 
	and make sure it is enabled. Back in the original dialogue it should be in 
	the dropdown. See if anything is installable and if so install it. 
	
	2) Enable the Maven/EGit connector with these instructions

CLONE THE REMOVE REPO AND IMPORT AS MAVEN

	3) Switch to the "Window > Open Prespective > Git Repository" perspective. 
	Copy the url following URL to the clipboard: 
		https://simbo1905@github.com/simbo1905/ZkToDo2.git
	In the left panel right click and "Paste Repository Path". This brings up a wizard 
	which results in making a local repo clone; the defaults should work. 
	
	4) Expand the local repository and right click on the "Working directory" and choose 
	"Import Maven Projects...". 
	
	5) Switch to the Java perspective. Right click on the project and choose "Team > Share Project".
	Select the checkbox "User or create repository in parent folder of project". 

COMPILE / RUN / DEBUG

6) "Debug As... > Maven Build..." In the goals textbox enter "package jetty:run".
Swith to the JRE tab and set a VM argument "-Djetty.port=8080" or whatever port 
you wish to run on. Switch to the Environment tab and set a variable "DATABASE_URL" 
to be your PostgreSQL server JDBC string e.g. 
	"postgres://foodToGoUser:foodToGoPassword@localhost/testdb"

7) Open a brower at "http://localhost:8080/

8) Set a break point BasicDao.findAll method. Refresh the browser. It should stop and show you
the "Source not found. Edit Source Lookup Path...". Click on that. Select "Add > Java Project" and 
select the project. You should now be at your break point ready to explore the code. 

End.
