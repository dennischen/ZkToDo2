
These instructions have been tested on Eclipse 3.6.1 "Helios" 

1) Get the Eclipse EGit plug-in 
	http://www.eclipse.org/egit/download/
	
2) Get the Eclipse m2eclipse plug-in for Maven  
	http://m2eclipse.codehaus.org/
The maven plug-in requires that your workspace is building with a jdk. If the 
plug-in complains that you are not using a jdk simply use "Eclipse > Preferences
> Java > Installed JREs" to add then select a jdk as the workspaces default 
java runtime. Alternatively edit the eclipse.ini of your installation and set a 
"-vm" flag to point at a jdk java executable. 

3) Switch to the "Git Repository" perspective. Copy the url following URL to the 
clipboard: 
	https://simbo1905@github.com/simbo1905/ZkToDo2.git
In the left panel right click and "Paste Repository Path". This brings up a wizard 
which results in making a local repo clone; the defaults should work. 

4) Expand the (local) ZkToDo2 repository. Right click on the 'Working directory' node 
and select 'Import Projects'. Import it as an existing project. 

5) Switch to the Java perspective. Right click on the project and choose 
"Run As... > Run Configurations..." and then right click on "Maven Build" and 
chose "New". Give it a name "jetty zktodo2". Use the "Browse Workspace" button 
to set the "Base Directory" to be the zktodo2 project. In the goals textbox 
enter "jetty:run" then click "Apply" then "Run".
